# Sefaria Sidebar Chrome Extension

Simple Chrome extension to display a sidebar with key references that are relevant to the webpage.

At the present moment, this is a prototype designed to work with dafhachaim.org and daf-yomi.com, by detecting the logical 'daf/amud' of gemara, and pulling in 'Ner Mitsvah/Ein Mishpat' links into a a sidebar.

Ultimately the aim is to crowdsource other websites where it's possible to recognize identity of elements on the page.  This may also be useful to replace the Sefaria Linker button which could now run automatically on whitelisted webpages, and leverage the sidebar for enhanced display.
